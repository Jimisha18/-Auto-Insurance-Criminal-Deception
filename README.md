# Auto-Insurance-Criminal-Deception

## Define the problem:
* The goal of this project is to build a model that identifies genuine auto claims from fraudulent ones. The challenge behind fraud detection in machine learning is that frauds are far less common as compared to legit insurance claims. This type of problems is known as imbalanced class classification.
* Frauds are unethical practices and are losses to the company.This model will help the auto insurance companies to pay the customers who are really affected by the accident and to screen the customers who are falsesome.
* If it is identified the claim submitted is not genuine it will go for manual inspection. And the person can put up proofs to conclude if his claim is genuine before the decision is made. By building this fraud classifier, one can cut losses for the insurance company.
